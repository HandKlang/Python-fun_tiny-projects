# Python-fun (smaller projects)
 A personal learning and development repository focused on building proficiency in Python programming. 
 
 This repo represents a documentation of my Python journey (eg. learnings, hands-on experimentation, creative projects, and tool developments).
 All the small-scale projects and completed tasks from courses that helped me learn and improve will be collected here.
  
 While initially I aim to improve my core Python skills, the long-term vision is to apply this knowledge to real-world use cases in energy management and renewable energy systems.
 This includes developing scripts, simulations, and data-driven tools that support smarter, more sustainable energy solutions.
